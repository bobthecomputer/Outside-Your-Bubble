# Agent Guidelines
- Before starting any work, read both `PROGRESS.md` **and** `docs/roadmap.md` to understand current goals, plans, and preserved references.
- After completing any task, update `PROGRESS.md` with an **Update** entry summarizing what changed and capturing new objectives/follow-ups.
- Keep `docs/ui-prototype.md` untouched except when intentionally refreshing the preserved UI concept.
